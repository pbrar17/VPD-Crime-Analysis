    "Pedestrians are some of the most vulnerable users of roadways. On average, in British Columbia, around 50 pedestrians are killed and 2,400 are injured in around 2,700 crashes every year, based on a five-year average of data collected by ICBC between 2016 and 2020 (ICBC, 2021).​​ Nearly half of these deaths occur between October and January, likely due to decreased daylight and poor weather conditions. Governments and law enforcement are using various safety campaigns to try and deal with these issues, it is possible that more can be done to reduce pedestrian deaths in key regions in Metro Vancouver. \n",
    " \n",
    "The question understudy for our project is: \"Are certain neighbourhoods more prone to vehicle collisions in the City of Vancouver?\" The dataset we are planning on using was made available to us by the VPD, and it contains information on all crimes committed from 2003 to 2022 (VPD, 2022). We intend to look at neighbourhood-specific data across the city and we will specifically look at the “Vehicle Collision or Pedestrian Struck with Fatality” and “Vehicle Collision or Pedestrian Struck with Injury” related data. While the data values include both vehicle-to-vehicle collisions and pedestrian/cyclist strikes together, the description notes that vehicle-to-vehicle incidents are fewer in number when compared to the overall data set. We want to see if there is any discernible pattern for the neighbourhoods that have higher collision rates, such as if the neighbourhoods have lower government funding, lower socioeconomic status, or if collision rates are more evenly spread.\n",
    " \n",
    "An article by Sarah Fecht in Scientific American that looked into road designs in Montreal found that “traffic injuries are four to six times higher in low-income areas of Montreal, compared with wealthy neighbourhoods” (Fecht, 2012). Fecht notes that there may be “many explanations for social inequalities in traffic injuries, including differences in the prevalence of drunk driving, use of helmets and safety restraints, and driving speeds”. However, citing a 2011 study on the influence of traffic volume and road design (Morency et al., 2012), Fetch suggests that “street environment” may also carry a large part of the blame”. As this would be a serious concern that could be mitigated through direct intervention, we wanted to further explore whether this may also be occurring in Vancouver as well.\n",
    " \n",
    " We plan on using the proportion of Vehicular/Pedestartain accidents compared to all other crimes in that neighbourhood, to approach this question. Looking at the proportion will help us weed out outliers, that way we are only looking at the neighbourhood that has a significantly higher number of Pedestrian/Vehicular accidents per all the crimes reported. We will also be drawing 95% Confidence Intervals for each proportion for better results. The 95CI will help us be more confident in our answers."

This information may also motivate the City of Vancouver to prioritize renewal plans for older areas and “poorer” areas of the city. This information could also be used by researchers developing self-driving technologies to reduce the chance of the vehicle being involved in such an incident. Furthermore, this project may lead to further questions on other factors that also increase the likelihood of vehicle collisions, such as specific weather or daylight conditions. This would account for a possible confounding variable.\n"

While we may not have been able to determine that we have successfully determined that there is a difference in the proportion of Vehicualar/Pedestarian Accidents depending on the neighbourhood, it is up to future studies to go deeper into this, and look determine the reasons for this difference. A question like \"are the neighbourhoods that have a higher rate of vehicle/pedestrian accidents more socioeconomically disadvantaged\" would have to be carried out in a separate study. Our study simply implies that there are indeed some heavy outliers and variations in vehicle/pedestrian accidents between the cities of Vancouver.
