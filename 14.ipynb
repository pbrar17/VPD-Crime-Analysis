    "Introduction: The Question We are trying to answer is \"Are there certain neigbourhoods that are more prone to vehicle/pedestrian accidents than others, and does the time of year have any affect on this?\" We plan on using the mean and most likely the SD to narrow this down, as the mean will tell us the average that we are going to work with, and having as lower SD as possible would indicate that our mean is a good value to use, as the values are all clustered closer to it. And we would use the median and compare the mean with it to see if there are any outliers present that could be affecting our resutls, if there are than we would just use the median for everything if the outliers have a huge impact on it."
